# Executing Plans

Execute written implementation plans efficiently using Superpower Loop for continuous iteration through all phases.

## CRITICAL: Loop Mode Detection First

Before any other action, determine whether this skill is running inside an existing multi-phase loop.

1. If `.claude/superpower-loop.local.md` exists and contains `phases:`:
   - Treat this run as an in-pipeline phase.
   - **Do NOT start another loop** with `setup-superpower-loop.sh`.
   - Continue directly with plan execution.
2. If no active multi-phase loop exists (standalone invocation):
   - Resolve the plan path from `$ARGUMENTS` (if provided) or by searching `docs/plans/`.
   - Start a dedicated loop using an isolated state file:
```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-superpower-loop.sh" "Execute the plan at <resolved-plan-path>. Continue progressing through the superpowers:executing-plans skill phases: Phase 1 (Plan Review) → Phase 2 (Task Creation) → Phase 3 (Batch Execution) → Phase 4 (Verification) → Phase 5 (Git Commit) → Phase 6 (Completion)." --completion-promise "EXECUTION_COMPLETE" --max-iterations 100 --state-file ".claude/superpower-loop-executing-plans.local.md"
```
3. Only after mode detection/loop startup is complete, proceed to verify the plan folder and continue execution.

**Rationale**: Starting a nested loop on `.claude/superpower-loop.local.md` will overwrite the parent phase state and break automatic continuation.

## Superpower Loop Integration

This skill uses Superpower Loop to enable self-referential iteration throughout the execution process.

**CRITICAL**: Throughout the process, you MUST output `<promise>EXECUTION_COMPLETE</promise>` only when:
- Phase 1-5 (Plan Review, Task Creation, Batch Execution, Verification, Git Commit) are all complete
- All tasks executed and verified
- User approval received in Phase 4
- Git commit completed

Do NOT output the promise until ALL conditions are genuinely TRUE.

**ABSOLUTE LAST OUTPUT RULE**: The promise tag MUST be the very last text you output. Output any transition messages or instructions to the user BEFORE the promise tag. Nothing may follow `<promise>EXECUTION_COMPLETE</promise>`.

## Initialization

(Loop mode has already been determined above - do NOT start another loop here.)

1. **Resolve Plan Path** (must complete to build the prompt for the loop above):
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` provides a path (e.g., `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-plan/`), use it as the plan source.
   - If no argument is provided:
     - Search `docs/plans/` for the most recent `*-plan/` folder matching the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-*-plan/`
     - If found, confirm with user: "Execute this plan: [path]?"
     - If not found or user declines, ask the user for the plan folder path.
2. **Plan Check**: Verify the folder contains `_index.md` with "Execution Plan" section.
3. **Context**: Read `_index.md` completely. This is the source of truth for your execution.

The loop will continue through all phases until `<promise>EXECUTION_COMPLETE</promise>` is output.

## Background Knowledge

**Core Principles**: Review before execution, batch verification, explicit blockers, evidence-driven approach.

**MANDATORY SKILLS**: Both `superpowers:agent-team-driven-development` and `superpowers:behavior-driven-development` must be loaded regardless of execution mode.

## Definition of Done

These rules are non-negotiable and override all other guidance.

**PROHIBITED outputs** — a task MUST NOT be marked `completed` if it produces any of the following:
- Stub files: files containing only function signatures, `pass`, or `...` with no logic
- Placeholder implementations: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `NotImplemented`, `raise NotImplementedError`, or equivalent in any language
- Empty function bodies: functions that return a hardcoded default or `None`/`null` without executing real logic
- Skeleton-only files: files with only imports, type declarations, or class definitions but no method bodies

**A task is "done" only when ALL of the following are true:**
1. Verification commands from the task file exit with code 0
2. Expected output matches actual output (no test failures, no assertion errors)
3. No prohibited patterns exist in any file written during the task

**On verification failure:**
- The task MUST remain `in_progress`
- Fix the issue and re-run verification
- If blocked after two retries, escalate per `./references/blocker-and-escalation.md`
- NEVER mark a task `completed` after a failed verification

## Phase 1: Plan Review & Understanding

1. **Read Plan**: Read `_index.md` to understand scope, architecture decisions, and extract inline YAML task metadata from the "Execution Plan" section.
2. **Understand Project**: Explore codebase structure, key files, and patterns relevant to the plan.
3. **Check Blockers**: See `./references/blocker-and-escalation.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Creation (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: You MUST use TaskCreate to create ALL tasks BEFORE executing any task. Task creation must complete before dependency analysis or execution begins.

1. **Extract Tasks from _index.md**: Read `_index.md` only. Parse the inline YAML metadata in the "Execution Plan" section to extract:
   - `id`: Task identifier (e.g., "001")
   - `subject`: Brief title in imperative form (e.g., "Implement login handler")
   - `slug`: Hyphenated slug for filename (e.g., "implement-login-handler")
   - `type`: Task type (test, impl, setup, config, refactor)
   - `depends-on`: Array of task IDs this task depends on (e.g., ["001"])

2. **Create Tasks First**: Use TaskCreate to register every task
   - Set `subject` from YAML `subject` field
   - Set `description` to: "See task file: ./task-{id}-{slug}-{type}.md for full details including BDD scenario and verification steps"
   - Set `activeForm` by converting subject to present continuous form (e.g., "Setting up project structure")
   - All tasks MUST be created before proceeding to the next phase
   - Do NOT read individual task files during this phase — they are read on-demand during execution

3. **Analyze Dependencies**: After all tasks are created, build the dependency graph
   - Compute dependency tiers: Tier 0 = no dependencies, Tier N = all depends-on tasks are in earlier tiers
   - Within each tier, group tasks by type to maximize parallelism (e.g., all "write test" tasks together, all "implement" tasks together)
   - **Identify Red-Green Pairs**: Scan all task filenames for matching NNN prefixes (e.g., `task-002-auth-test` + `task-002-auth-impl`). Mark each such pair as a **Red-Green pair** — these are always scheduled as a coordinated unit in the same batch. The test task retains its Tier 0 position; the impl task follows immediately after in the same batch execution (not a separate batch).
   - **Target**: Each batch should contain 3-6 tasks
   - **Rule**: Every batch must contain ≥2 tasks unless it is the sole remaining batch

4. **Setup Task Dependencies**: Use TaskUpdate to configure dependencies between tasks
   - `addBlockedBy`: Array of task IDs this task must wait for before starting
   - `addBlocks`: Array of task IDs that must wait for this task to complete
   - Example: `TaskUpdate({ taskId: "2", addBlockedBy: ["1"] })` means task #2 waits for task #1

## Phase 3: Batch Execution Loop

Execute tasks in batches using Agent Teams or subagents for parallel execution.

**For Each Batch**:

1. **Choose Execution Mode** (strict priority — justify any downgrade explicitly):
   - **Red-Green Pair (MANDATORY)**: If the batch contains a Red-Green pair (same NNN prefix, one `test` + one `impl`), assign exactly two dedicated agents — one per task. The test agent runs first: writes the failing test and confirms Red state. Once Red is confirmed, the impl agent starts: implements to make the test pass. Two agents, coordinated sequence within the pair. Multiple pairs across batches run in parallel. This is non-negotiable and overrides all other mode selection rules for that pair.
   - **Agent Team** (default): Use unless a specific technical reason prevents it. File conflicts or sequential `depends-on` within a batch are NOT valid reasons to downgrade — resolve by splitting the batch further.
   - **Agent Team + Worktree**: Launch parallel agents with worktree isolation when multiple agents edit overlapping files or for competitive implementation (N solutions, pick best).
   - **Subagent Parallel** (downgrade only if): Agent Team overhead is disproportionate (e.g., batch has exactly 2 small tasks). State the reason explicitly.
   - **Linear** (last resort only if): Tasks within the batch have unavoidable file conflicts that cannot be split, or the batch genuinely contains only 1 task. State the reason explicitly.

2. **For Each Task in Batch**:

   a. **Mark Task In Progress**: Use TaskUpdate to set status to `in_progress`

   b. **Read Task Context**: Read the task file to get full context (subject, description, BDD scenario, verification steps)

   c. **Execute Task**: Based on execution mode:

      **Mandatory prompt content** — regardless of execution mode, every agent/teammate prompt MUST include:
      1. Full task file content (subject, description, BDD scenario, verification commands)
      2. The Quality Requirements block: "You MUST produce complete, working implementation code — not stubs, skeletons, or placeholders. Every function body must contain real logic. If you cannot implement something completely, stop and report a blocker."
      3. The Verification block: "After implementation, run the verification commands below and confirm they all pass (exit code 0, no test failures). Report the actual command output. Do NOT report completion until all verification commands pass."

      See `./references/batch-execution-playbook.md` — "Agent Prompt Template" section — for the full required template.

      **For Agent Team / Worktree mode**:
      - Create team if not already created
      - Assign task to available teammate using the mandatory prompt template above
      - Wait for teammate to complete and report verification output

      **For Subagent mode**:
      - Launch subagent using the mandatory prompt template above
      - Wait for subagent to complete and report verification output

      **For Linear mode**:
      - Execute task directly in current session
      - Follow BDD scenario and verification steps
      - Run verification commands and capture output

   d. **Verification Gate**: Run all verification commands from the task file. Capture the actual output.
      - For test tasks: Confirm test fails for the right reason (Red state confirmed)
      - For impl tasks: Confirm all tests pass (Green state confirmed, exit code 0)
      - For other tasks: Confirm verification command exits 0 and output matches expected

      **HARD GATE**: If ANY verification step fails (non-zero exit, test failure, unexpected output):
      - The task MUST remain `in_progress`
      - Fix the issue and re-run verification (up to two retries)
      - If still failing after two retries, escalate per `./references/blocker-and-escalation.md`
      - NEVER proceed to step 2e while any verification is failing

   e. **Mark Task Complete**: Only after ALL verification steps in 2d pass, use TaskUpdate to set status to `completed`. Include in the update: which verification commands ran and that they passed.

3. **Batch Completion**: After all tasks in batch complete, report progress and proceed to next batch

See `./references/batch-execution-playbook.md` for detailed execution patterns.

## Phase 4: Verification & Feedback

Close the loop with structured evidence.

1. **Publish Evidence**: For each completed task in the batch, output a structured evidence block:
   ```
   Task [ID]: [subject]
   Verification command: <command run>
   Output: <actual output, truncated to last 20 lines if long>
   Status: PASS / FAIL
   ```
   Any task without a PASS evidence block is NOT verified. Do not proceed to confirmation until all tasks have PASS status.

2. **Confirm**: Present the evidence summary to the user and ask: "All tasks in this batch verified. Proceed to the next batch?" Get explicit confirmation before continuing.

3. **Loop**: Repeat Phase 3-4 until all batches complete.

## Phase 5: Git Commit

Commit the implementation changes to git with proper message format.

See `../../skills/references/git-commit.md` for detailed patterns, commit message templates, and requirements.

**Critical requirements**:
- Commit only after Phase 4 user confirmation
- Prefix: `feat(<scope>):` for implementation changes
- Subject: Under 50 characters, lowercase
- Footer: Co-Authored-By with model name
- Commit should reflect the completed feature, not individual tasks
- Use meaningful scope (e.g., `feat(auth):`, `feat(ui):`, `feat(db):`)

## Phase 6: Completion

Output the promise as the absolute last line.

Output in this exact order:
1. Summary message: "Plan execution complete. All tasks verified and committed."
2. `<promise>EXECUTION_COMPLETE</promise>` — nothing after this

**PROHIBITED**: Do NOT output any text after the promise tag.

## Exit Criteria

All tasks executed and verified, evidence captured, no blockers, user approval received, final verification passes, git commit completed.
