## Success Indicators

**High Quality Brainstorming Session**:
- Explored codebase before asking questions
- Resolved most gaps automatically based on exploration
- Proposed options grounded in existing patterns
- Finalized approach with explicit rationale and assumptions
- Launched core sub-agents in parallel for design creation
- Launched additional sub-agents as needed for specialized research
- Integrated all sub-agent results successfully
- Launched reflection sub-agents in parallel for gap identification
- Synthesized and prioritized reflection findings
- Updated design documents based on reflection findings
- Design document is comprehensive and actionable with BDD scenarios
- Saved design files with proper structure inside dated folder
- Committed design folder as checkpoint before implementation

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Asking questions without exploring codebase first
- Asking avoidable questions that could be inferred automatically
- Proposing abstract options not grounded in reality
- Pausing for manual A/B/C selection when safe defaults exist
- Skipping alternatives without clear rationale
- Launching sub-agents without providing complete context
- Not integrating sub-agent results before creating documents
- Launching too many sub-agents for simple features (stay focused)
- Skipping reflection phase - "it looks fine, let's just commit"
- Single-agent reflection - not leveraging parallel sub-agents
- Ignoring sub-agent findings - not acting on identified gaps
- Superficial fixes - adding content without proper integration
- Missing BDD specifications or best practices sections
- Saving design to wrong location (should be `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design/`)
- Committing individual files instead of entire folder
- Jumping to implementation without committing design
